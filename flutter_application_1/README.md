# Flutter Counter App - Project Notebook

## Overview

This project is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates fundamental concepts and widgets of Flutter through a counter application. The application allows users to increment and reset a counter. It includes a main screen with buttons to interact with the counter and demonstrates state management in Flutter.

## Key Concepts and Widgets

### main.dart

- **MyApp Class**: The root widget of the application.
- **MaterialApp Widget**: Configures the app-wide theme and sets the home screen.

## Key Concepts

### State Management

In this project, state management is handled using `StatefulWidget` and `setState()` method. The `setState()` method is used to notify the framework that the internal state has changed, causing the widget to rebuild.

### Theming

The application uses `ThemeData` to apply a consistent theme across the app. The `colorSchemeSeed` is used to seed the color scheme for the application.

### Layout

The `Scaffold` widget is used to create the basic layout of the app, including the `AppBar` and the body. The `Column` widget is used to arrange the children widgets vertically.

### Widgets

Several core widgets are used, including `Text`, `Icon`, and `FloatingActionButton`, each demonstrating different aspects of Flutter's widget system.
